      Whether to include build information in the resulting snap.

      This will add snap/manifest.yaml and snap/snapcraft.yaml files
      to the snap.  The Snap Store can use this information to detect
      snaps with security vulnerabilities introduced through
      stage-packages.

      Proprietary applications may want to disable this due to
      the information leakage.
    default: 'true'
  snapcraft-channel:
    description: >
      The Snapcraft channel to use

      By default, the action will use the stable version of Snapcraft
      to build the project.  This parameter can be used to instead
      select a different channel such as beta, candidate, or edge.
    default: 'stable'
  snapcraft-args:
    description: >
      Additional arguments to pass to Snapcraft

      Some experimental Snapcraft features are disabled by default and
      must be turned on via a `--enable-experimental-*` command line
      argument.  This parameter can be used to turn on such features.
    default: ''
  ua-token:

      UA token to attach in build environment.

      Snapcraft will detach the token when no longer required.

      `SNAPCRAFT_MAX_PARALLEL_BUILD_COUNT` to control
